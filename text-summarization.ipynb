to build Cadillacs in Sweden\n\nGeneral Motors, the world's largest\ncar maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized\nCadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.\n\nThe car,\nunveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the\nmedium-sized luxury car market.  It will not be sold in the US, said\nGM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.  As part of its efforts to\nmake the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the\nfirst Cadillac with a diesel engine.\n\nGM's announcement should go some\nway to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure.  The factory in\nTrollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned\nsevere cutbacks in its troubled European operations.  But the group's\nnew commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the\ngroup's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany.  They may now have to\nface a larger proportion of GM's cuts.\n\nNeither will the announcement\nbe seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's\nfailure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury\ncar market.  For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing\nhead-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar.  The segment's leaders do not\nagree.\n\nGM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of\nits efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European\ndrivers.  In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand\n- even the presidential limousine carries the badge.  Yet it could\nprove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in\nEurope.  Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary\nLexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to\nmake significant inroads in Europe.  There, German marques Mercedes\nBenz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.\nBringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce\ndesperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces\nfewer than 130,000 cars per year.  That is about half of what major\ncar makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and\nSaab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m\n(£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year.  Beyond the 12,000\njob cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is\nreducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in\nthe UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the\ndifferent brands to share parts.  Another way to further reduce Saab's\nlosses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a\nmarket where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.\nDoing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is\nmaking Saabs more expensive to US consumers.  But not everyone in the\nindustry agree that it would be the best way forward.  \"We know that\nin five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the\nchief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.  The\ncurrent trend towards US production was \"stupid\", he said.\n\nIn a\nseparate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European\nconsumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models.  It\nis to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting\npotential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours.  It follows a\nsimilar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change\n\"customers' perceptions\" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them\nthat the quality had improved in recent years.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nsummary = pipeline(\"summarization\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-22T11:58:48.020991Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-22T11:58:48.021934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-22T12:00:16.809017Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-22T11:58:48.021878Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-22T12:00:16.807392Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (4.26.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.27 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (4.64.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (2021.11.10)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (1.21.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: huggingface-hub<1.0,>=0.11.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (0.12.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: requests in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (2.28.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (23.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyyaml>=5.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (6.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tokenizers!=0.11.3,<0.14,>=0.11.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (0.13.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (4.11.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: filelock in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from transformers) (3.9.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.7.4.3 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from huggingface-hub<1.0,>=0.11.0->transformers) (4.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from importlib-metadata->transformers) (3.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.14)\nRequirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4)\n\u001b[33mWARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.
